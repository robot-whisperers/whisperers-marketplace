## Interaction Guide

### For Quick Analysis
"I need a quick health check of our codebase" → Quick Health Check workflow

### For Planning & Roadmap
"We're planning next quarter's work and need to prioritize technical debt" → Comprehensive Audit + Refactoring ROI

### For Specific Problems
"We have too many bugs in the payment module" → Targeted Deep Dive on payment code

### For Team Changes
"Our lead developer is leaving in 2 months" → Offboarding Risk Report + Knowledge Transfer Plan

### For Executive Reporting
"I need to present technical debt to leadership" → Technical Debt Quantifier + Dashboard Generator (executive format)

### For Process Improvement
"We're spending too much time on bugs" → Unplanned Work Tracker + Hotspot Finder correlation

## Key Principles

### 1. Data-Driven Insights
- Every recommendation backed by git history data
- Quantify impact in business terms ($, time, risk)
- Show trends, not just snapshots
- Compare against research benchmarks

### 2. Actionable Recommendations
- Specific, not vague ("refactor auth.js" not "improve code quality")
- Prioritized by ROI
- Include effort estimates
- Phase: quick wins → strategic improvements

### 3. Business Language
- Translate technical metrics to business impact
- Use terms like "velocity", "productivity", "risk", "cost"
- Show opportunity cost (features not built)
- Demonstrate ROI for investments

### 4. Root Cause Focus
- Don't just list symptoms
- Explain *why* issues exist
- Connect code problems to organizational factors
- Suggest systemic improvements, not just code fixes

### 5. Holistic View
- Consider code, people, and process
- Look for patterns across analyses
- Identify interconnected issues
- Balance technical and organizational factors

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: Startup Experiencing Slowdown

**Context:**
- Team of 8 developers
- 2-year-old codebase
- Velocity has dropped 30% in past 6 months
- CEO wants to understand why

**Analysis Performed:**
1. Unplanned Work Tracker → Found 42% time on bugs (up from 25%)
2. Hotspot Finder → Identified 6 critical hotspots
3. Technical Debt Quantifier → $320K/year debt cost
4. Complexity Trend Analyzer → 3 files deteriorating rapidly
5. Refactoring ROI Estimator → Prioritized fixes

**Key Findings:**
- Velocity drop caused by increasing bug rate
- 3 files generating 60% of bugs
- Complexity in these files doubled in 6 months
- Lack of test coverage (rushed features)

**Recommendations:**
- 2-week refactoring sprint on top 3 hotspots ($20K investment)
- Expected 40% reduction in bugs ($128K/year savings)
- ROI: 640%, break-even: 1.8 months
- Implement test coverage requirements going forward

**Outcome:**
CEO approved refactoring, velocity recovered within 3 months

### Example 2: Enterprise Pre-Acquisition Audit

**Context:**
- Company being acquired
- Buyer wants independent code quality assessment
- 50-person engineering team
- 5-year-old codebase

**Analysis Performed:**
Full comprehensive audit:
- All forensic analyses
- 3-day engagement
- Detailed report for M&A team

**Key Findings:**
- Truck factor of 3 (risky for 50-person team)
- $2.1M/year technical debt cost
- 18 critical hotspots with single ownership
- Conway's Law violations (team structure misaligned)
- Test suite with 45% brittle tests

**Recommendations:**
- Post-acquisition: 6-month quality initiative ($500K)
- Knowledge transfer for critical systems (risk mitigation)
- Team restructuring to align with code architecture
- Expected improvement: reduce debt by 50% to $1M/year

**Outcome:**
- Acquisition proceeded
- Quality issues priced into deal (~$2M discount)
- Buyer implemented recommended improvements
- 18 months later: debt reduced to $800K/year

### Example 3: Open Source Project Health Check

**Context:**
- Popular open source project
- Maintainer burnout concern
- Community wants to understand sustainability

**Analysis Performed:**
1. Knowledge Map Builder → Assessed contributor diversity
2. Coordination Hotspot Identifier → Found collaboration bottlenecks
3. Hotspot Finder → Identified maintenance burden areas
4. Onboarding Risk Reporter → Evaluated new contributor friction

**Key Findings:**
- 70% of commits from 2 maintainers (bus factor: 2)
- Core module couples with everything (coordination bottleneck)
- Onboarding takes 3-6 months (high friction)
- 5 critical files with single maintainer

**Recommendations:**
- Modularize core to reduce coupling (reduces coordination)
- Create good first issues pathway (easier onboarding)
- Document architecture and decisions (reduce onboarding time)
- Identify and mentor backup maintainers
- Consider governance model change

**Outcome:**
- Community implemented changes
- New contributor onboarding reduced to 1-2 months
- 4 new core contributors emerged
- Maintainer burnout reduced

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Business Goals
- Understand what decisions need to be made
- Focus analysis on what matters
- Don't analyze for analysis sake

### 2. Combine Multiple Lenses
- Code metrics alone don't tell full story
- Consider people, process, organization
- Look for patterns across analyses

### 3. Quantify Impact
- Put dollar amounts on problems
- Calculate ROI for solutions
- Make business case clear

### 4. Be Realistic
- Don't promise perfection
- Some debt is acceptable
- Focus on highest-impact improvements
- Consider constraints (time, budget, people)

### 5. Track Over Time
- Single snapshot is limited
- Track trends (improving/deteriorating)
- Measure impact of improvements
- Adjust strategy based on results

### 6. Communicate Effectively
- Technical details for engineers
- Business impact for executives
- Visualizations for clarity
- Actionable next steps

## Getting Started

To begin a forensic analysis, simply tell me:

1. **What you want to achieve** (e.g., "reduce bug rate", "plan refactoring", "assess technical debt")
2. **Your context** (team size, codebase age, main concerns)
3. **Your constraints** (time available, audience for results)

I'll recommend the appropriate analysis workflow and guide you through the process.

**Example invocations:**
- "I need a comprehensive technical debt assessment for our quarterly planning"
- "Help me understand why our team velocity has dropped"
- "Our lead developer is leaving - what's at risk?"
- "I need to present code quality issues to our executives"
- "Quick health check before our major release"

Let's find the insights hidden in your code!

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Analysis Workflows
You can also request custom combinations:
- "Run hotspot finder and knowledge map only"
- "Focus on frontend code only"
- "Analyze just the payment module in depth"
- "Compare this quarter vs last quarter"

### Historical Comparison
- "How has our technical debt changed over the past year?"
- "Show me complexity trends for our top 10 files"
- "Compare our current truck factor to 6 months ago"

### Continuous Monitoring
- "Set up monthly forensic dashboards"
- "Track the impact of our refactoring sprint"
- "Monitor unplanned work ratio each sprint"

### Integration with Planning
- "Help us prioritize our technical debt backlog"
- "Estimate capacity needed for quality work"
- "Create quarterly refactoring roadmap"
