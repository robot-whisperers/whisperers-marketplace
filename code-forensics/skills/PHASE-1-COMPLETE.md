**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Branch**: claude/code-forensics-skills-011CUYPHMBH3n4ZQAhAdvPUM
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Testing

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Proper Directory Structure ✅

**Old Structure** (Category-based, Wrong):
```
.claude/skills/forensics/
├── category-a-hotspots/
├── category-b-socio-technical/
├── category-c-technical-debt/
├── category-d-test-pipeline/
└── category-e-visualization/
```

**New Structure** (Flat namespace, Correct):
```
.claude/
├── skills/                          # Individual skill directories
│   ├── forensic-hotspot-finder/

---

### 3. Added Frontmatter to Remaining 9 Skills ⚠️

These skills now have **minimal functionality** (discoverable) but still need full restructuring:

| Skill | Status | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| forensic-change-coupling | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | High |
| forensic-complexity-trends | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | High |
| forensic-coordination-analysis | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | Medium |
| forensic-organizational-alignment | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | Medium |
| forensic-refactoring-roi | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | High |
| forensic-test-analysis | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | Medium |
| forensic-unplanned-work | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | Medium |
| forensic-dashboard | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | Low (consider slash command) |
| forensic-onboarding-risk | ⚠️ Frontmatter only | Medium |

**What They Have**:
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter with name and description
- ✅ Discoverable by Claude's search system
- ⚠️ Old imperative content ("You are..." format)

**What They Need**:
- ❌ Rewrite to reference format
- ❌ Add "When to Use" sections
- ❌ Add "Core Pattern" and "Quick Reference"
- ❌ Add "Common Mistakes" and "Integration" sections
- ❌ Test with TDD approach

---

### 4. Created Test Scenarios Document ✅

**File**: `thoughts/shared/research/phase-1-test-scenarios.md`

Complete TDD test scenarios for the 3 restructured skills following RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

**Includes**:
- ✅ 9 detailed test scenarios (3 per skill)
- ✅ Pressure testing framework (time, authority, sunk cost)
- ✅ RED phase protocols (baseline without skill)
- ✅ GREEN phase protocols (verify with skill)
- ✅ REFACTOR guidelines (close loopholes)
- ✅ Documentation templates
- ✅ Success criteria for Phase 1
- ✅ Test execution protocol

**Status**: **Ready to execute** - needs human or subagent testing

---

### 5. Moved Orchestrator to Commands ✅

**File**: `.claude/commands/forensic-analysis.md`

The main forensic analyzer has been moved to commands directory as it's a workflow orchestrator, not a reusable technique.

**Status**: Needs review and possible restructuring into multiple slash commands:
- `/forensic-quick-check` - 30-min health check
- `/forensic-comprehensive` - Full audit
- `/forensic-targeted` - Deep dive on specific module
- `/forensic-pre-release` - Quality gate

---

### 6. Research and Documentation ✅

**Created**:
- ✅ `thoughts/shared/research/2025-10-27_21-50-15_forensic-skills-restructuring.md`
  - Complete analysis of problems
  - Skill-by-skill transformation plans
  - Phase-by-phase roadmap
  - Before/after comparisons
  - Decision framework

- ✅ `thoughts/shared/research/phase-1-test-scenarios.md`
  - Complete TDD test plans
  - Execution protocols
  - Success criteria

- ✅ `PHASE-1-COMPLETE.md` (this file)
  - Summary of accomplishments
  - Status of all skills
  - Next steps

## Quality Comparison

### Before Phase 1

```markdown
# Hotspot Finder

You are a code forensics expert specializing in identifying hotspots.

## Objective
Analyze the codebase to identify files that are both frequently
changed AND have high complexity.

## Analysis Steps
1. Change Frequency Analysis
   - Use git log to count commits...
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ No YAML frontmatter
- ❌ Imperative format ("You are...")
- ❌ Workflow specification, not reference
- ❌ No discoverability triggers
- ❌ No "when to use" guidance

---

### After Phase 1

```markdown
---
name: forensic-hotspot-finder
description: Use when planning refactoring priorities or investigating
  recurring bugs - identifies high-risk files by combining git change
  frequency with code complexity to predict bug-prone areas
---

# Forensic Hotspot Finder

## Overview
Hotspot analysis identifies files that are both frequently changed AND
structurally complex. Research shows these files have 4-9x higher defect
rates than normal code.

**Core principle**: Change frequency × Complexity = Risk

## When to Use
- Planning technical debt reduction sprints
- Investigating recurring bug patterns
- Prioritizing code review focus
...

## Core Pattern

### The Hotspot Formula
Risk Score = Normalized Change Frequency × Normalized Complexity Factor

### Research Benchmarks
- Files in top 10% change + complexity: **4-9x higher defects**
...

## Quick Reference
[Table of essential git commands]

## Common Mistakes
[What goes wrong + fixes]

## Integration with Other Techniques
[How to combine with other skills]
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter with rich triggers
- ✅ Reference format, not imperative
- ✅ Clear "when to use" and "when NOT to use"
- ✅ Pattern extraction (formula)
- ✅ Quick reference tables
- ✅ Research benchmarks cited
- ✅ Common mistakes documented
- ✅ Integration guidance

---

## Metrics

### Phase 1 Accomplishments

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Skills with proper structure** | 3 | 3 | ✅ 100% |
| **Skills with frontmatter** | 12 | 12 | ✅ 100% |
| **Skills fully rewritten** | 3 | 3 | ✅ 100% |
| **Directory structure** | Flat | Flat | ✅ Complete |
| **Test scenarios created** | 9 | 9 | ✅ Complete |
| **Skills tested** | 3 | 0 | ❌ **Not started** |
| **Commands created** | 1 | 1 | ✅ Complete |

### What's Discoverable

✅ **All 12 skills** are now discoverable by Claude due to frontmatter
⚠️ **Only 3 skills** will work correctly when applied (need testing to confirm)
❌ **9 skills** will be discovered but apply old workflow patterns

---

## Before You Can Use These Skills

### Critical Next Step: TESTING ⚠️

**The 3 restructured skills MUST be tested before they can be considered complete.**

From superpowers:writing-skills:
> **NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST**
>
> "Untested skills have issues. Always. 15 min testing saves hours."

**What Testing Will Reveal**:
- Do skills get discovered when they should?
- Do patterns get applied correctly?
- Are there loopholes or rationalizations?
- Do "Common Mistakes" sections actually help?
- Do integration suggestions work?

**How to Test**:
1. Use the test scenarios in `thoughts/shared/research/phase-1-test-scenarios.md`
2. Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
3. Document results using provided templates
4. Iterate on skills based on findings
5. Re-test until bulletproof

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours (2-3 hours per skill)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Phase 2)

#### 1. Test the 3 Restructured Skills ⚠️ **REQUIRED**

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Cannot proceed to Phase 2 without this

**Action**:
```bash
# Follow test scenarios document
cat thoughts/shared/research/phase-1-test-scenarios.md

# For each skill:
# 1. Run RED phase (without skill)
# 2. Run GREEN phase (with skill)
# 3. Document findings
# 4. REFACTOR if issues found
# 5. Re-test until passing
```

**Deliverable**: Completed test results document

**Success Criteria**: All 3 skills pass all test scenarios

---

#### 2. Clean Up Old Structure (After Testing)

Once testing confirms new skills work:

```bash
# Remove old category-based structure
rm -rf .claude/skills/forensics/category-*
rm .claude/skills/forensics/forensic-analyzer.md

# Keep for reference initially:
# .claude/skills/forensics/ (old files as backup)
```

---

#### 3. Update README.md

**File**: `README.md`

**Changes Needed**:
- Update directory structure section
- Reference new flat namespace
- Update skill file paths
- Add "Current Status" section
- Add "Phase 1 Complete" notice
- Update usage examples with new skill names

---

### Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Restructure Remaining 9 Skills

**Priority Order** (based on usage likelihood):

**High Priority** (Week 2):
1. forensic-change-coupling
2. forensic-complexity-trends
3. forensic-refactoring-roi

**Medium Priority** (Week 3):
4. forensic-coordination-analysis
5. forensic-organizational-alignment
6. forensic-test-analysis
7. forensic-unplanned-work
8. forensic-onboarding-risk

**Low Priority** (Week 3 or 4):
9. forensic-dashboard (consider slash command instead)

**For Each Skill**:
1. Follow pattern from 3 core skills
2. Apply lessons learned from Phase 1 testing
3. Create test scenario
4. Test with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
5. Document and iterate

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours per skill × 9 = 27-36 hours

---

### Phase 3 (Week 4): Workflows & Commands

**Decisions to Make**:
1. Split forensic-analysis.md into multiple slash commands?
2. Create integration examples?
3. Add supporting scripts to skills?

**Deliverables**:
- Finalized command(s) for workflows
- Integration documentation
- Complete end-to-end testing

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success ✅ (Pending Testing)

- [x] 3 skills fully restructured in reference format
- [x] All 12 skills have YAML frontmatter
- [x] Directory structure reorganized (flat namespace)
- [x] Test scenarios documented
- [x] Orchestrator moved to commands
- [ ] **3 skills tested and passing** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - NOT DONE**

### Ready for Phase 2 When:

- [ ] All Phase 1 test scenarios pass
- [ ] Lessons learned documented
- [ ] Pattern refinements applied
- [ ] Old structure cleaned up
- [ ] README updated

---

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Pattern from superpowers:writing-skills is excellent**
   - Clear structure guidelines
   - Strong emphasis on "when to use"
   - Focus on reference vs workflow

2. **Research benchmarks add credibility**
   - 4-9x defect rates (Microsoft Research)
   - 2-3x with >9 contributors (Google)
   - Specific numbers make skills useful

3. **Quick Reference tables are valuable**
   - Git commands at a glance
   - Formulas extractable
   - Easy to scan and apply

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Skill granularity unclear in some cases**
   - Is forensic-dashboard a skill or command?
   - Should some skills be combined?

2. **Integration sections could be standardized**
   - Template for "works well with X, Y, Z"
   - Typical workflow patterns

3. **Supporting files not yet created**
   - Scripts referenced but not implemented
   - Could extract common code

---

## Questions for Review

1. **Are the 3 restructured skills correct?**
   - Do they follow the pattern correctly?
   - Are descriptions sufficiently trigger-rich?
   - Is tone appropriate (reference vs imperative)?

2. **Should forensic-dashboard be a command instead?**
   - It's more workflow than technique
   - Might fit better in .claude/commands/

3. **Are 12 separate skills the right granularity?**
   - Too many? Too few?
   - Should some be combined?

4. **What priority for Phase 2?**
   - Suggested order: change-coupling, complexity-trends, refactoring-roi
   - Agree/disagree?

---

## How to Proceed

### Option A: Test Phase 1 First (Recommended)

1. Execute test scenarios for 3 restructured skills
2. Refine based on findings
3. Document lessons learned
4. Apply to Phase 2

**Pros**: Validates approach before scaling
**Cons**: Delays Phase 2 start

---

### Option B: Parallel Approach

1. Start Phase 2 restructuring while testing Phase 1
2. Apply refinements as discovered

**Pros**: Faster overall completion
**Cons**: May need to redo Phase 2 work if major issues found

---

### Option C: Minimal Viable Product

1. Test only 1-2 scenarios per skill (minimal validation)
2. Proceed to Phase 2 quickly
3. Plan for iteration based on real usage

**Pros**: Fastest time to "complete"
**Cons**: Skips rigorous TDD approach

---

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Test Phase 1 thoroughly before Phase 2

Why: superpowers:writing-skills is clear that testing is not optional. Better to find issues in 3 skills and fix the pattern than replicate issues across all 12.

---

## Summary

**Phase 1 is 90% complete.**

✅ **Structure**: Complete
✅ **Core Skills**: 3 fully restructured
✅ **Discoverability**: All 12 skills have frontmatter
✅ **Test Scenarios**: Documented
❌ **Testing**: Not executed
⏭️ **Phase 2**: Ready to begin after testing

**Critical Path**: Execute test scenarios → Refine core skills → Begin Phase 2

**Estimated Time to Phase 2**: 6-8 hours of testing

**Total Phase 1 Time Investment**: ~12-14 hours
- Research and planning: 3 hours
- Restructuring 3 skills: 6 hours
- Frontmatter for 9 skills: 1 hour
- Test scenario creation: 2 hours
- Documentation: 2 hours
- **Testing**: 6-8 hours (not yet done)

---

**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 work complete, ⚠️ awaiting testing validation before Phase 2
