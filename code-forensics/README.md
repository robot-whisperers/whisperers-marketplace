## Overview

This repository contains 11 specialized skills and 2 slash commands that enable Claude Code to perform deep forensic analysis of your codebase using version control history. These tools help identify technical debt, code quality issues, team dynamics problems, and provide data-driven, actionable recommendations.

## What is Code Forensics?

Code forensics applies investigative techniques to version control history to understand:
- **Where** the problems are (hotspots)
- **Why** they exist (complexity, coordination, ownership)
- **What** to do about them (prioritized recommendations)
- **How much** they cost (business impact in dollars)

Unlike static analysis tools that only look at current code, forensic analysis leverages the rich history in git to reveal patterns invisible to traditional tools.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forensic-skills.git
cd forensic-skills
```

2. Copy the `.claude` directory to your project:
```bash
cp -r .claude /path/to/your/project/
```

3. The skills are now available in Claude Code!

### Business Language
- Technical metrics translated to business terms
- ROI calculations for all recommendations
- Executive summaries for non-technical stakeholders

### Actionable Recommendations
- Specific, not vague (e.g., "refactor auth.js", not "improve quality")
- Prioritized by impact and effort
- Phased (quick wins → strategic improvements)
- Include time and cost estimates

### Holistic Analysis
- Considers code, people, and process
- Correlates multiple analyses for deeper insights
- Identifies root causes, not just symptoms

### Continuous Monitoring
- Track trends over time
- Measure improvement efforts
- Regular health checks

## Research Foundation

These skills are based on research and principles from:

- **"Your Code as a Crime Scene" by Adam Tornhill** - Primary inspiration
- **Microsoft Research** - Studies on code churn and defect correlation
- **Google Engineering Practices** - Code review and quality metrics
- **Industry Standards** - Truck factor, cyclomatic complexity, test metrics

Key research findings applied:
- Files with high change frequency + high complexity have 4-9x more defects
- Files with >9 contributors have 2-3x higher bug rates
- Unplanned work >40% correlates with low team morale
- Technical debt compounds at ~15-20% annually if unaddressed

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Business Goals
Don't analyze for the sake of analysis. Ask:
- What decision needs to be made?
- What problem are we solving?
- Who needs the information?

### 2. Run Regular Health Checks
- Monthly quick health checks (30-60 min)
- Quarterly comprehensive audits (4-8 hours)
- Track trends over time

### 3. Prioritize Ruthlessly
- Focus on highest ROI improvements
- Quick wins build momentum
- Balance urgent fixes with strategic improvements

### 4. Measure Results
- Track metrics before/after refactoring
- Validate ROI assumptions
- Adjust strategy based on results

### 5. Communicate Effectively
- Technical details for engineers
- Business impact for executives
- Visualizations for clarity

### 6. Act on Insights
Analysis without action is waste. Always:
- Create actionable backlog items
- Assign owners
- Set deadlines
- Follow through

## Technical Requirements

- **Git repository** - All analyses use git history
- **Claude Code** - Designed as Claude Code skills
- **Git command line** - Must be available in environment

**Recommended:**
- 12+ months of git history (more is better)
- Active development (regular commits)
- Descriptive commit messages (improves analysis quality)

**Optional but helpful:**
- Issue tracking system (for defect correlation)
- CI/CD logs (for test performance analysis)
- Code coverage reports

## Limitations

### What These Skills Can Do
✅ Identify problem areas using git history
✅ Quantify technical debt and impact
✅ Prioritize improvements by ROI
✅ Reveal organizational and coordination issues
✅ Track trends over time

### What These Skills Cannot Do
❌ Automatically fix code issues
❌ Replace human judgment and expertise
❌ Detect all types of technical debt (e.g., API design issues)
❌ Guarantee specific outcomes
❌ Work without git history

### Important Caveats
- Analysis quality depends on git history quality
- Metrics are indicators, not absolute truth
- Context matters - interpret with domain knowledge
- ROI estimates are projections, not guarantees
- Requires follow-through to realize benefits
