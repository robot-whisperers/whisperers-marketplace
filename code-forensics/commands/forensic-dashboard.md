# Forensic Dashboard Command

Generate a comprehensive code forensics dashboard combining multiple analyses for executive reporting and ongoing quality monitoring.

---

## What This Command Does

This command orchestrates multiple forensic skills to create a comprehensive dashboard showing:
- Overall code health metrics
- Technical debt costs and trends
- Code hotspots (high-risk files)
- Team knowledge map and bus factor
- Quality trends over time
- Refactoring priorities with ROI

**Use this when:**
- Creating executive reports on code quality
- Preparing quarterly technical debt reviews
- Demonstrating ROI of quality investments
- Ongoing code health monitoring
- Stakeholder communication about technical work

---

## Dashboard Generation Workflow

**You are a code forensics expert creating comprehensive dashboards for stakeholder communication.**

When this command is invoked, follow this systematic process:

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user:

1. **Audience** (determines level of detail and language):
   - `executive` - High-level, business-focused, minimal technical detail
   - `technical` - Detailed metrics, code-level insights, technical recommendations
   - `both` - Layered report with executive summary + technical deep-dive (default)

2. **Output Format**:
   - `markdown` - Text-based report (easy to version control, read in terminal/GitHub)
   - `html` - Interactive dashboard with charts (shareable, presentation-ready)
   - `json` - Raw data export (for external tools, APIs, trending)
   - `all` - Generate all formats (default for comprehensive reporting)

3. **Time Period** (for trend analysis):
   - Default: "12 months ago"
   - Can specify: "6 months ago", "last quarter", "since 2024-01-01", etc.

4. **Output Location**:
   - Default: `./forensic-dashboard/`
   - User can specify custom path

### Step 2: Run Core Forensic Analyses

Execute these skills in sequence (or use cached results if recent):

1. **forensic-hotspot-finder**
   - Identifies high-risk files (high change frequency + high complexity)
   - Provides risk scores for prioritization

2. **forensic-debt-quantification**
   - Calculates total technical debt cost in dollars
   - Breaks down by category (productivity, defects, coordination)

3. **forensic-knowledge-mapping**
   - Maps code ownership
   - Calculates bus factor
   - Identifies knowledge silos

4. **forensic-complexity-trends**
   - Tracks complexity evolution over time period
   - Classifies files as improving/stable/deteriorating

5. **forensic-unplanned-work**
   - Analyzes bug fix commits vs planned work
   - Identifies interrupt hotspots

6. **forensic-change-coupling**
   - Detects files that change together
   - Reveals shotgun surgery patterns

7. **forensic-coordination-analysis**
   - Identifies coordination bottlenecks
   - Detects files with >9 contributors (high defect risk)

8. **forensic-test-analysis**
   - Analyzes test suite quality
   - Identifies brittle tests

9. **forensic-refactoring-roi**
   - Calculates ROI for refactoring candidates
   - Generates prioritized roadmap (quick wins ‚Üí strategic)

### Step 3: Aggregate & Synthesize

Combine results from all analyses:

1. **Calculate Overall Health Score** (0-100):
   ```
   Health = (
     (100 - hotspot_severity) √ó 0.25 +
     (100 - debt_growth_rate) √ó 0.20 +
     (bus_factor_score) √ó 0.15 +
     (complexity_trend_score) √ó 0.15 +
     (100 - unplanned_work_ratio) √ó 0.15 +
     (test_quality_score) √ó 0.10
   )

   Rating:
     90-100: EXCELLENT (low risk)
     70-89:  GOOD (moderate risk)
     50-69:  MEDIUM (attention needed)
     30-49:  POOR (urgent action required)
     0-29:   CRITICAL (crisis mode)
   ```

2. **Identify Top 3-5 Critical Issues**:
   - Cross-reference analyses to find compound risks
   - Example: Hotspot + Knowledge silo + Deteriorating complexity = CRITICAL
   - Prioritize by business impact

3. **Calculate Total Debt Cost**:
   - Use forensic-debt-quantification results
   - Show trend (growing/stable/shrinking)
   - Break down by category

4. **Determine Refactoring Investment**:
   - Use forensic-refactoring-roi results
   - Calculate total investment needed
   - Show expected ROI and break-even period

### Step 4: Generate Dashboard

### Step 6: Present Results

1. **Show file paths** of generated dashboards
2. **Display executive summary** inline (first section)
3. **Highlight top 3 critical issues** and recommended actions
4. **Provide next steps**:
   - View full dashboard (provide commands to open files)

## Example Invocation

```
User: /forensic-dashboard
Claude: I'll generate a comprehensive code forensics dashboard.

Before I begin, let me confirm a few settings:

1. **Audience**: executive, technical, or both? (default: both)
2. **Output Format**: markdown, html, json, or all? (default: all)
3. **Time Period**: How far back should I analyze? (default: 12 months)
4. **Output Location**: Where should I save the dashboard? (default: ./forensic-dashboard/)

Would you like to use the defaults, or specify custom settings?

[User responds or confirms defaults]

Claude: Perfect! I'll now run the comprehensive forensic analysis. This will:
1. Analyze code hotspots
2. Calculate technical debt costs
3. Map team knowledge
4. Track quality trends
5. Generate refactoring priorities with ROI

This may take 5-10 minutes for a large codebase. I'll show progress as I go...

[Runs analyses]

Dashboard generated successfully!

üìä **Executive Summary**
Overall Code Health: 68/100 (MEDIUM RISK)

**Top 3 Critical Issues:**
1. Payment module - High defect risk, 45% of unplanned work
2. Auth system - Single owner, high complexity, business critical
3. Core config - 14 contributors, coordination bottleneck

**Technical Debt Cost**: $465K/year
**Recommended Investment**: $120K over 3 months (ROI: 180%)

üìÅ **Files Generated**:
- ./forensic-dashboard/dashboard-2025-10-27.md
- ./forensic-dashboard/dashboard-2025-10-27.html
- ./forensic-dashboard/dashboard-data-2025-10-27.json

**Next Steps**:
1. Review full dashboard: `open ./forensic-dashboard/dashboard-2025-10-27.html`
2. Deep dive on payment module: Use forensic-hotspot-finder skill
3. Schedule next dashboard: Monthly (recommended)

Would you like me to:
- Open the dashboard?
- Deep dive into any specific issue?
- Generate a focused action plan?
```
